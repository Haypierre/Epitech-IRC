# Epitech-IRC 2nd year project

In this repository is an IRC statefull server and a client application.                             
They are both coded in C.                                                                           
You will find generic data structure sources used in the project (Double linked list and circular buffer).                                                                                                                                     
Clone sources then compile and run the server with : make server ; make client && ./server port     
The server is RFC 1459 complient, as for the updates versions.                                                                                                                                         
You can now run the client -- All the commands available are listed in irc_client subdirectory.

Since the client is in progress, you should test the server using : netcat 127.0.0.1 (localhost) port.
